# EVIL-Godot-Runtime
## What's this?
EVIL default runtime adjusted for Godot, with some Godot specific modules sprinkled in.

## What's EVIL?
[This](https://github.com/vddCore/EVIL)

## Why not fork the entire repo?
I don't need to change core parts of the language, just the runtime.

## Why?
Unnamed Godot project I'm using EVIL in needs some stuff changed for EVIL to work properly, eg. you sure won't be reading console inputs from Godot.

## Credits
Original EVIL.Ceres.Runtime project (and the language itself) was created by [vddCore](https://github.com/vddCore). Link to EVIL repo with its GNU LGPL 3.0 license is above.
